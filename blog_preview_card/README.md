## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Of all the things I learnt and implemented, being able to create a transition upon the cursor hovering on the element was what stood out for me.

Here's the code snippet of how i implemented the hover effect:

```css
.text-link {
  color: inherit;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 0.4s;
}

.text-link:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  transition-delay: 0.2s;
}
```
